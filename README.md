Zip Brute Force (Educational Project)

This is a simple **Python brute force script** that tries to crack the password of a protected `.zip` file using a wordlist (like `rockyou.txt`).  
This project was built as part of a **Forage AIG Cybersecurity job simulation** to demonstrate how brute force attacks work in practice and to complete the simulation.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do **not** use it on files you don’t own or without permission.
